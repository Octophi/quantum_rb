This project was a 2018 Duke Opportunities in Math project conducted under the supervision of Professor Calderbank and Professor Pfister. This repository contains a report with a summary of important notions in quantum error correction and also contains the code to recreate the randomized benchmarking procedure implemented in https://arxiv.org/abs/1806.02359.
